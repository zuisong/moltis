Inspired by [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai) — just build it and run it.

## Installation

```bash
# macOS / Linux via Homebrew
brew install penso/tap/moltis

# Or build from source
cargo install moltis-cli --git https://github.com/penso/moltis
```

Moltis compiles your entire AI gateway — web UI, LLM providers, tools, and
all assets — into a single self-contained executable. There is no Node.js
process to babysit, no `node_modules` to keep in sync, no V8 garbage collector
introducing latency spikes mid-conversation. Tokio's async runtime handles
thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections with a fraction of the memory
footprint, and Rust's ownership model means secrets wrapped in
`secrecy::Secret` are zeroed on drop — not "eventually collected."

What you get out of the box:

- **Single binary deployment** — `cargo build --release` produces one file
  that embeds the web UI, serves HTTP, speaks WebSocket, and connects to
  Telegram. Copy it anywhere and run it.
- **Native Apple Container support** — Sandbox commands in Docker *or* macOS
  Containers (macOS 15+), with automatic backend selection. No other open-source
  AI gateway does this.
- **Compile-time safety** — Every LLM provider, tool, hook, and channel is
  wired through traits. Misconfigurations that would be a runtime crash in
  TypeScript are caught by `cargo check`.
- **Streaming-first** — Token streaming is not bolted on; it is the primary
  path. Responses start appearing the moment the first token arrives.
- **Lock-free hook circuit breaker** — Hooks that fail repeatedly are
  auto-disabled using atomic counters, not mutexes. They re-enable themselves
  after a cooldown — no manual intervention.
- **Auto-compaction** — When a conversation approaches 95 % of the model's
  context window, history is summarized and important facts are persisted to
  the memory store. On context-window-exceeded errors the agent loop
  automatically compacts and retries once.

## Features

- **Multi-provider LLM support** — OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub Copilot, and more
  through a trait-based provider architecture
- **Streaming responses** — real-time token streaming for a responsive user
  experience, including when tools are enabled (tool calls stream argument
  deltas as they arrive)
- **Communication channels** — Telegram integration with an extensible channel
  abstraction for adding others
- **Web gateway** — HTTP and WebSocket server with a built-in web UI
- **Session persistence** — SQLite-backed conversation history, session
  management, and per-session run serialization to prevent history corruption
- **Agent-level timeout** — configurable wall-clock timeout for agent runs
  (default 600s) to prevent runaway executions
- **Sub-agent delegation** — `spawn_agent` tool lets the LLM delegate tasks to
  child agent loops with nesting depth limits and tool filtering
- **Message queue modes** — `followup` (replay each queued message as a
  separate run) or `collect` (concatenate and send once) when messages arrive
  during an active run
- **Tool result sanitization** — strips base64 data URIs and long hex blobs,
  truncates oversized results before feeding back to the LLM (configurable
  limit, default 50 KB)
- **Memory and knowledge base** — embeddings-powered long-term memory
- **Skills and plugins** — extensible skill system and plugin architecture
- **Hook system** — lifecycle hooks with priority ordering, parallel dispatch
  for read-only events, circuit breaker, dry-run mode, HOOK.md-based discovery,
  eligibility checks, bundled hooks (boot-md, session-memory, command-logger),
  and CLI management (`moltis hooks list/info`)
- **Web browsing** — web search (Brave, Perplexity) and URL fetching with
  readability extraction and SSRF protection
- **Scheduled tasks** — cron-based task execution
- **OAuth flows** — built-in OAuth2 for provider authentication
- **TLS support** — automatic self-signed certificate generation
- **Observability** — OpenTelemetry tracing with OTLP export
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) support** — connect to MCP tool servers over
  stdio or HTTP/SSE (remote servers), with health polling, automatic restart
  on crash (exponential backoff), and in-UI server config editing
- **Parallel tool execution** — when the LLM requests multiple tool calls in
  one turn, they run concurrently via `futures::join_all`, reducing latency
- **Sandboxed execution** — Docker and Apple Container backends with pre-built
  images, configurable packages, and per-session isolation
- **Authentication** — password and passkey (WebAuthn) authentication with
  session cookies, API key support, and a first-run setup code flow
- **WebSocket security** — Origin validation to prevent Cross-Site WebSocket
  Hijacking (CSWSH)
- **Onboarding wizard** — guided setup for agent identity (name, emoji,
  creature, vibe, soul) and user profile
- **Default config on first run** — writes a complete `moltis.toml` with all
  defaults so you can edit packages and settings without recompiling
- **Random port per installation** — each fresh install picks a unique available
  port, avoiding conflicts when multiple users run moltis on the same machine
- **Zero-config startup** — `moltis` runs the gateway by default; no subcommand
  needed
- **Configurable directories** — `--config-dir` / `--data-dir` CLI flags and
  `MOLTIS_CONFIG_DIR` / `MOLTIS_DATA_DIR` environment variables
- **Tailscale integration** — expose the gateway over your tailnet via Tailscale
  Serve (private HTTPS) or Funnel (public HTTPS), with status monitoring and
  mode switching from the web UI (optional `tailscale` feature flag)

## Quickstart

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/penso/moltis.git
cd moltis
cargo build --release

# Start the gateway (gateway is the default command)
cargo run --release
```

On first launch, a one-time setup code is printed to the terminal. Open
`http://localhost:3000` in your browser, enter the code, and set a password or
register a passkey. From there you can configure LLM providers and start
chatting.

## How It Works

Moltis is a **local-first AI gateway** — a single Rust binary that sits
between you and multiple LLM providers. Everything runs on your machine; no
cloud relay required.

### Gateway startup

When `moltis gateway` runs, it loads `moltis.toml`, initializes the credential
store (passwords, passkeys, API keys), registers LLM providers and tools,
discovers hooks and skills, optionally starts the memory manager, and
pre-builds a sandbox image if configured. An Axum HTTP server then listens for
WebSocket and REST connections.

### Message flow

1. **Connect** — A client (web UI, Telegram bot, API key bearer) opens a
   WebSocket. The server validates auth and Origin headers, then assigns a
   connection ID.
2. **Send** — The client calls the `chat.send` RPC method with message text
   and an optional model override. The gateway resolves the session, persists
   the user message to a JSONL file, loads conversation history, and builds a
   system prompt (agent identity, project context, discovered skills).
3. **Agent loop** — If the chosen provider supports tool calling, an agent
   loop runs (up to 25 iterations). Each iteration calls the LLM, inspects the
   response for tool calls, fires `BeforeToolCall` / `AfterToolCall` hooks,
   executes tools inside the sandbox, appends results, and loops until the LLM
   produces a final text answer. If tools are not available, the provider
   streams tokens directly.
4. **Broadcast** — Every step (thinking, tool start/end, text deltas, final
   response) is broadcast over the WebSocket as sequenced events. The web UI
   renders them in real time.
5. **Channel replies** — If the message originated from Telegram or another
   channel, the final response is delivered back through that channel's
   outbound interface.

### Sessions and memory

Conversations are stored as append-only JSONL files under
`~/.moltis/agents/<agent>/sessions/`. A SQLite database tracks metadata
(message counts, model selection, project bindings, channel bindings).
When token usage approaches 95% of the context window, the session is
auto-compacted: history is summarized and important facts are persisted to the
memory store.

The optional memory manager watches `memory/` directories for Markdown files,
chunks them by heading, embeds the chunks, and stores vectors in SQLite for
hybrid (vector + full-text) search. Memory context is injected into the system
prompt automatically.

### Hooks

Lifecycle hooks let you observe, modify, or block actions at key points.
Modifying events (`BeforeToolCall`, `BeforeCompaction`, `MessageSending`) run
sequentially — a hook can rewrite arguments or block execution. Read-only
events (`AfterToolCall`, `SessionEnd`, `GatewayStart`, …) run in parallel.
Hooks are discovered from `HOOK.md` files and include a circuit breaker that
auto-disables after repeated failures.

### Security model

Moltis applies defense in depth across several layers:

- **Authentication** — On first run a one-time setup code is printed to the
  terminal. The user enters it to set a password or register a WebAuthn
  passkey. Subsequent requests are authenticated via session cookies or API key
  bearer tokens. Connections from loopback addresses (localhost, 127.0.0.1,
  ::1) are allowed without credentials as a safe default for local use.
- **WebSocket Origin validation** — The WebSocket upgrade handler rejects
  cross-origin requests to prevent Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). A
  malicious webpage cannot connect to your local gateway from the browser.
- **SSRF protection** — The `web_fetch` tool resolves DNS before making HTTP
  requests and blocks any target IP in loopback, private, link-local, or CGNAT
  ranges. This prevents the LLM from reaching internal services.
- **Secret handling** — Passwords, API keys, and tokens are stored as
  `secrecy::Secret<String>`, which redacts `Debug` output, prevents accidental
  `Display`, and zeroes memory on drop. Environment variable values injected
  into sandbox sessions are redacted from command output (including base64 and
  hex encoded forms).
- **No unsafe code** — `unsafe_code` is denied workspace-wide. The only
  exception is an opt-in FFI wrapper behind the `local-embeddings` feature flag.
- **Hook gating** — `BeforeToolCall` hooks can inspect, modify, or block any
  tool invocation before it executes, giving you a programmable policy layer
  over what the agent is allowed to do.

### Sandboxed execution

User commands never run directly on the host. They execute inside isolated
containers using either Docker or Apple Container as the backend.

At startup the gateway builds a deterministic image from the configured base
image (`ubuntu:25.10` by default) and the package list in `moltis.toml`. The
image tag is a hash of the base image + sorted packages — if you add or remove
a package, the tag changes and a rebuild is triggered automatically.

Each command invocation gets a per-session container. Environment variables
configured for the agent are injected into the container, but their values are
redacted from any output the LLM sees (plain text, base64, and hex forms) to
prevent leaking secrets through tool results.

## Getting Started

### Build

```bash
cargo build              # Debug build
cargo build --release    # Optimized build
```

### Run

```bash
cargo run                # Start the gateway server (default command)
```

On first run, a setup code is printed to the terminal. Open the web UI and
enter this code to set your password or register a passkey.

Optional flags:

```bash
cargo run -- --config-dir /path/to/config --data-dir /path/to/data
```

### Test

```bash
cargo test --all-features
```

## Hooks

Moltis includes a hook dispatch system that lets you react to lifecycle events
with native Rust handlers or external shell scripts. Hooks can observe, modify,
or block actions.

### Events

`BeforeToolCall`, `AfterToolCall`, `BeforeAgentStart`, `AgentEnd`,
`MessageReceived`, `MessageSending`, `MessageSent`, `BeforeCompaction`,
`AfterCompaction`, `ToolResultPersist`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`,
`GatewayStart`, `GatewayStop`, `Command`

### Hook discovery

Hooks are discovered from `HOOK.md` files in these directories (priority order):

1. `<workspace>/.moltis/hooks/<name>/HOOK.md` — project-local
2. `~/.moltis/hooks/<name>/HOOK.md` — user-global

Each `HOOK.md` uses TOML frontmatter:

```toml
+++
name = "my-hook"
description = "What it does"
events = ["BeforeToolCall"]
command = "./handler.sh"
timeout = 5

[requires]
os = ["darwin", "linux"]
bins = ["jq"]
env = ["SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"]
+++
```

### CLI

```bash
moltis hooks list              # List all discovered hooks
moltis hooks list --eligible   # Show only eligible hooks
moltis hooks list --json       # JSON output
moltis hooks info <name>       # Show hook details
```

### Bundled hooks

- **boot-md** — reads `BOOT.md` from workspace on `GatewayStart`
- **session-memory** — saves session context on `/new` command
- **command-logger** — logs all `Command` events to JSONL

### Shell hook protocol

Shell hooks receive the event payload as JSON on stdin and communicate their
action via exit code and stdout:

| Exit code | Stdout | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| 0 | (empty) | Continue |
| 0 | `{"action":"modify","data":{...}}` | Replace payload data |
| 1 | — | Block (stderr used as reason) |

### Configuration

```toml
[[hooks]]
name = "audit-tool-calls"
command = "./examples/hooks/log-tool-calls.sh"
events = ["BeforeToolCall"]

[[hooks]]
name = "block-dangerous"
command = "./examples/hooks/block-dangerous-commands.sh"
events = ["BeforeToolCall"]
timeout = 5

[[hooks]]
name = "notify-discord"
command = "./examples/hooks/notify-discord.sh"
events = ["SessionEnd"]
env = { DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..." }
```

See `examples/hooks/` for ready-to-use scripts (logging, blocking dangerous
commands, content filtering, agent metrics, message audit trail,
Slack/Discord notifications, secret redaction, session saving).

### Sandbox Image Management

```bash
moltis sandbox list          # List pre-built sandbox images
moltis sandbox build         # Build image from configured base + packages
moltis sandbox clean         # Remove all pre-built sandbox images
moltis sandbox remove <tag>  # Remove a specific image
```

The gateway pre-builds a sandbox image at startup from the base image
(`ubuntu:25.10`) plus the packages listed in `moltis.toml`. Edit the
`[tools.exec.sandbox] packages` list and restart — a new image with a
different tag is built automatically.
