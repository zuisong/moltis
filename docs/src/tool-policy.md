# Tool Policy

Tool policies control which tools are available during a session. Before these
name-based layers run, Moltis applies the registry's host-owned audience
ceiling. Guest, shared-room, and unknown-topology channel turns receive no
tools by default. Supported channel accounts can explicitly lift that ceiling
and hand tool selection back to these policy layers. Webhooks receive no tools
by default and can explicitly opt into tools registered for public use. Policy
layers may narrow or widen access only within the host-owned ceiling selected
for the request.

Within the audience ceiling, policies use a layered system where each layer can
restrict or widen access, and **deny always wins** — once a tool is denied at
any layer, no later layer can re-allow it.

## Layers

Six layers are evaluated in order. Later layers can replace the allow list,
but deny entries accumulate across all of them.

| # | Layer | Config path | Applies to |
|---|-------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Global | `[tools.policy]` | All sessions |
| 2 | Per-provider | `[providers.<name>.policy]` | Requests routed through that provider |
| 3 | Per-agent preset | `[agents.presets.<id>.tools]` | Sub-agents spawned with that preset |
| 4 | Per-channel chat type | `[channels.<type>.<account>.tools.groups.<chat_type>]` | Channel sessions matching that chat type |
| 5 | Per-sender | `...groups.<chat_type>.by_sender.<sender_id>` | Messages from that sender in that chat type |
| 6 | Sandbox | `[tools.exec.sandbox.tools_policy]` | Commands running inside a sandbox container |

**Web UI sessions** see layers 1-3 (no channel context), plus layer 6 if sandboxed.
**Channel sessions** can see all 6 layers.

## Merge Semantics

Each layer produces an `allow` list and a `deny` list. When merging a
higher-priority layer on top of a lower one:

- **Deny accumulates.** Every deny entry from every layer is collected. If
  any layer denies a tool, it stays denied.
- **Allow replaces.** A non-empty allow list from a later layer replaces the
  previous allow list entirely. An empty allow list is a no-op (keeps the
  previous allow list).
- **Empty allow = permit all.** When the effective allow list is empty,
  everything not denied is allowed.

## Glob Patterns

Both `allow` and `deny` entries support glob-style patterns:

- `"*"` — matches every tool name
- `"browser*"` — matches any tool whose name starts with `browser`
- `"exec"` — matches only the exact tool name `exec`

## Profiles

The global layer and per-sender overrides support a `profile` field that
expands to a predefined allow list before the explicit allow/deny entries
are applied.

| Profile | Allow list |
|---------|-----------|
| `"minimal"` | `exec` |
| `"coding"` | `exec`, `browser`, `memory` |
| `"full"` | `*` (everything) |

When a profile is set, its allow list is applied first, then the explicit
`allow`/`deny` from the same layer are merged on top (deny accumulates,
non-empty allow replaces).

## Layer 1 — Global

The base policy for all sessions. Set in `moltis.toml` under `[tools.policy]`:

```toml
[tools.policy]
allow = []           # empty = permit all tools not denied
deny = ["browser"]   # deny browser in every session
# profile = "full"   # optional named profile
```

## Layer 2 — Per-Provider

Each provider entry can carry its own policy. When a request is routed
through that provider, the policy is merged on top of the global layer.

```toml
[providers.openai]
# ... api_key, models, etc.
policy.deny = ["exec"]
```

This denies `exec` whenever OpenAI is the active provider, regardless of
what the global layer allows. Other providers are unaffected.

## Layer 3 — Per-Agent Preset

Agent presets (used by `spawn_agent`) can restrict their sub-agent's tools.

```toml
[agents.presets.researcher]
model = "anthropic/claude-haiku-3-5-20241022"
tools.allow = ["read_file", "glob", "grep", "web_search", "web_fetch"]
tools.deny  = ["exec", "write_file"]
```

When the `researcher` preset is active, only the five listed tools are
allowed, and `exec`/`write_file` are explicitly denied. See
[Agent Presets](agent-presets.md) for the full preset reference.

> **Note:** Preset tool policies apply only to sub-agents spawned via
> `spawn_agent`. They do not affect the main agent session. Use the global
> `[tools.policy]` for the main session.

## Layer 4 — Per-Channel Chat Type

Channel accounts can restrict tools by chat type (`private`, `group`,
`channel`, etc.). By default, guest, shared-room, and unknown-topology turns
have a deny-all ceiling, so this layer primarily narrows tools available to an
operator in a proven direct chat. Telegram and Slack accounts can explicitly
lift that ceiling and hand the decision back to these policy layers:

- `untrusted_audience = "public"` (default) limits tool eligibility to the public
  audience; `"trusted"` makes MCP, WASM, and other trusted-audience tools eligible.
- `untrusted_tools = "deny_all"` (default) denies all tool names; `"policy"`
  removes that blanket denial and lets configured policy layers decide.

MCP tools require **both** `untrusted_audience = "trusted"` and
`untrusted_tools = "policy"`. An allow list or sender override alone cannot
bypass either default. These opt-ins are account-wide for turns outside an
operator direct chat, including guest DMs and shared or unknown chat kinds.
Restrict group/channel access and DM access as well as tool policies before
enabling them; without restrictive policies, every tool allowed by the remaining
layers becomes available.

For UI-managed accounts, set these fields through Advanced Config JSON in
**Settings > Channels**. Channel settings are stored in `data_dir()/moltis.db`,
not written back to `moltis.toml`. Database-backed `tools.groups` policies are
not currently part of runtime policy resolution, so use a restrictive global
or provider policy before lifting the ceiling. See
[Telegram](telegram.md#tools-in-shared-chats) and
[Slack](slack.md#tools-in-shared-channels) for account-specific guidance.

```toml
[channels.telegram.my-bot.tools.groups.private]
deny = ["exec", "browser"]
```

In this example, `exec` and `browser` are denied in Telegram direct chats
handled by the `my-bot` account. Web UI sessions are unaffected.

## Layer 5 — Per-Sender

Within a channel chat type, individual senders can receive name-policy
overrides. Overrides cannot cross the default deny-all ceiling applied to
guests, shared rooms, and unknown chat kinds unless the account explicitly
lifts that ceiling.

```toml
[channels.telegram.my-bot.tools.groups.private]
deny = ["exec", "browser"]

[channels.telegram.my-bot.tools.groups.private.by_sender."123456"]
allow = ["*"]
```

Sender `123456` gets `allow = ["*"]`, which replaces the previous allow list.
However, because **deny always accumulates**, the `exec` and `browser` denials
from the chat-type layer still apply. By default, the sender must also be a
configured operator in a proven direct chat; a sender override alone never
grants tools. A supported channel account can instead opt its untrusted turns
into trusted-audience, policy-based access with `untrusted_audience = "trusted"`
and `untrusted_tools = "policy"`.

## Layer 6 — Sandbox

When a session runs inside a sandbox container, this layer applies on top of
all other layers. It lets you restrict tools for sandboxed execution without
affecting non-sandboxed sessions.

```toml
[tools.exec.sandbox.tools_policy]
allow = ["exec"]         # only exec inside sandbox
deny = ["browser"]       # never allow browser in sandbox
```

This layer is skipped entirely when the session is not sandboxed.

## Examples

### Deny exec for a specific provider

```toml
[providers.openai]
policy.deny = ["exec"]
```

When using OpenAI, the agent cannot run shell commands. All other
providers retain their normal tool access.

### Restrict operator DMs on Telegram

```toml
[channels.telegram.my-bot.tools.groups.private]
deny = ["exec", "browser*"]
```

Operators in proven direct chats cannot use `exec` or any tool starting with
`browser`. Guest and shared-room turns already receive no tools unless the
account explicitly lifts the default ceiling.

### Narrow one operator in direct chats

```toml
[channels.telegram.my-bot.tools.groups.private]
allow = ["web_search", "web_fetch"]

[channels.telegram.my-bot.tools.groups.private.by_sender."123456"]
allow = ["web_search"]
```

Operator `123456` can only search in a proven direct chat. Other operators in
direct chats can search and fetch. With the default audience ceiling, this
configuration grants nothing to guests or shared-room participants.

### Agent preset with limited tools

```toml
[agents.presets.researcher]
tools.allow = ["read_file", "glob", "grep"]
tools.deny  = ["exec"]
```

The `researcher` sub-agent can only read files and search. Even if a
higher layer allows `exec`, it is denied here and the denial carries
through.

### Use a profile for the global policy

```toml
[tools.policy]
profile = "coding"
deny = ["web_fetch"]
```

The `coding` profile expands to `allow = ["exec", "browser", "memory"]`.
Then `web_fetch` is denied. The effective policy allows `exec`, `browser`,
and `memory`, and denies `web_fetch`. All other tools are not in the allow
list and are therefore blocked.

### Apply a profile to an operator DM

```toml
[channels.telegram.my-bot.tools.groups.private]
allow = ["web_search"]

[channels.telegram.my-bot.tools.groups.private.by_sender."123456"]
profile = "full"
```

Operator `123456` gets `allow = ["*"]` from the `full` profile, replacing the
chat-type allow list in a proven direct chat. With the default audience ceiling,
the same sender still receives no tools as a guest or in a shared or unknown chat.

## Debugging

Enable `debug` logging to see which layers are applied at runtime:

```
policy: applied global profile 'coding'
policy: applied global layer
policy: applied provider layer    provider=openai
policy: applied agent preset layer agent_id=researcher
policy: applied group layer       channel=telegram account_id=my-bot group_id=group
policy: applied sender layer      channel=telegram group_id=group sender_id=123456
policy: applied sandbox layer
```

Each line indicates a layer was non-empty and merged into the effective
policy. Missing lines mean that layer had no configuration or the runtime
context did not match (e.g., no channel context for a web UI session).
