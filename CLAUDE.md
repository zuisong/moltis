# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## General

This is doing a Rust version of openclaw. Openclaw documentation is available at
https://docs.openclaw.ai and its code is at https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw

All code you write must have tests with high coverage. Always check for Security
to make code safe.

## Cargo Features

When adding a new feature behind a cargo feature flag, **always enable it by
default** in the CLI crate (`crates/cli/Cargo.toml`) unless explicitly asked
otherwise. Features should be opt-out, not opt-in. This prevents the common
bug where a feature works when tested in isolation but isn't compiled into
the main binary.

Example: when adding a `foo` feature to the gateway crate, also add:
```toml
# crates/cli/Cargo.toml
[features]
default = ["foo", ...]  # Add to defaults
foo = ["moltis-gateway/foo"]  # Forward to gateway
```

## Rust Style and Idioms

Write idiomatic, Rustacean code. Prioritize clarity, modularity, and
zero-cost abstractions.

### Traits and generics

- Always use traits to define behaviour boundaries — this allows alternative
  implementations (e.g. swapping MCP transports, storage backends, provider
  SDKs) and makes testing with mocks straightforward.
- Prefer generic parameters (`fn foo<T: MyTrait>(t: T)`) for hot paths where
  monomorphization matters. Use `dyn Trait` (behind `Arc` / `Box`) when you
  need heterogeneous collections or the concrete type isn't known until
  runtime.
- Derive `Default` on structs whenever all fields have sensible defaults — it
  pairs well with struct update syntax and `unwrap_or_default()`.

### Typed data over loose JSON

Use concrete Rust types (`struct`, `enum`) instead of `serde_json::Value`
wherever the shape is known. This gives compile-time guarantees, better
documentation, and avoids stringly-typed field access. Reserve
`serde_json::Value` for truly dynamic / schema-less data.

### Concurrency

- Always prefer streaming over non-streaming API calls when possible.
  Streaming provides a better, friendlier user experience by showing
  responses as they arrive.
- Run independent async work concurrently with `tokio::join!`,
  `futures::join_all`, or `FuturesUnordered` instead of sequential `.await`
  loops. Sequential awaits are fine when each step depends on the previous
  result.
- Never use `block_on` or any blocking call inside an async context (see
  "Async all the way down" below).

### Error handling

- Use `anyhow::Result` for application-level errors and `thiserror` for
  library-level errors that callers need to match on.
- Propagate errors with `?`; avoid `.unwrap()` outside of tests.

### General style

- Prefer iterators and combinators (`.map()`, `.filter()`, `.collect()`)
  over manual loops when they express intent more clearly.
- Use `Cow<'_, str>` when a function may or may not need to allocate.
- Keep public API surfaces small: expose only what downstream crates need
  via `pub use` re-exports in `lib.rs`.
- Prefer `#[must_use]` on functions whose return value should not be
  silently ignored.

### Tracing and Metrics

**All crates must include tracing and metrics instrumentation.** This is
critical for telemetry, debugging, and production observability.

- Add `tracing` feature to crate's `Cargo.toml` and gate instrumentation
  with `#[cfg(feature = "tracing")]`
- Add `metrics` feature and gate counters/gauges/histograms with
  `#[cfg(feature = "metrics")]`
- Use `tracing::instrument` on async functions for automatic span creation
- Record metrics at key points: operation counts, durations, errors, and
  resource usage

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "tracing")]
use tracing::{debug, instrument, warn};

#[cfg(feature = "metrics")]
use moltis_metrics::{counter, histogram, labels};

#[cfg_attr(feature = "tracing", instrument(skip(self)))]
pub async fn process_request(&self, req: Request) -> Result<Response> {
    #[cfg(feature = "metrics")]
    let start = std::time::Instant::now();

    // ... do work ...

    #[cfg(feature = "metrics")]
    {
        counter!("my_crate_requests_total").increment(1);
        histogram!("my_crate_request_duration_seconds")
            .record(start.elapsed().as_secs_f64());
    }

    Ok(response)
}
```

See `docs/metrics-and-tracing.md` for the full list of available metrics,
Prometheus endpoint configuration, and best practices.

## Build and Development Commands

```bash
cargo build              # Build the project
cargo build --release    # Build with optimizations
cargo run                # Run the project
cargo run --release      # Run with optimizations
```

## Web UI Assets

Assets live in `crates/gateway/src/assets/` (JS, CSS, HTML). The gateway
serves them in two modes:

- **Dev (filesystem)**: When `cargo run` detects the source tree, assets are
  served directly from disk. Edit JS/CSS and reload the browser — no Rust
  recompile needed. You can also set `MOLTIS_ASSETS_DIR` to point elsewhere.
- **Release (embedded)**: When the binary runs outside the repo, assets are
  served from the copy embedded at compile time via `include_dir!`. URLs are
  versioned (`/assets/v/<hash>/...`) with immutable caching; the hash changes
  automatically on each build.

When editing JavaScript files, run `biome check --write` to lint and format
them. No separate asset build step is required.

**HTML in JS**: Avoid creating HTML elements from JavaScript. Instead, add
hidden elements in `index.html` (with `style="display:none"`) and have JS
toggle their visibility. This keeps markup in HTML where it belongs and makes
the structure easier to inspect. Preact components (HTM templates) are the
exception — they use `html` tagged templates by design.

### Styling and UI Consistency

**Always use Tailwind utility classes instead of inline `style="..."` attributes.**
This applies to all properties — spacing (`p-4`, `gap-3`), colors
(`text-[var(--muted)]`, `bg-[var(--surface)]`), typography (`font-mono`,
`text-xs`, `font-medium`), layout (`flex`, `grid`, `items-center`), borders
(`border`, `rounded-md`), and anything else Tailwind covers. Only fall back to
inline styles for truly one-off values that have no Tailwind equivalent (e.g. a
specific `max-width` or `grid-template-columns` pattern).

Keep buttons, links, and other interactive elements visually consistent with
the existing UI. Reuse the shared CSS classes defined in `components.css`:

- **Primary action**: `provider-btn` (green background, white text).
- **Secondary action**: `provider-btn provider-btn-secondary` (surface
  background, border).
- **Destructive action**: `provider-btn provider-btn-danger` (red background,
  white text). Never combine `provider-btn` with inline color overrides for
  destructive buttons.

When buttons or selects sit next to each other (e.g. in a header row), they
must share the same height and text size so they look like a cohesive group.
Use `provider-btn` variants for all of them rather than mixing ad-hoc Tailwind
button styles with different padding/font sizes.

Before creating a new CSS class, check whether an existing one already covers
the use case. Duplicating styles (e.g. a second green-button class) leads to
drift — consolidate instead.

**Building Tailwind**: After adding or changing Tailwind utility classes in JS
or HTML files, you **MUST** rebuild the CSS for the changes to take effect.
Tailwind only generates CSS for classes it finds in the source files at build
time — new classes won't work until CSS is rebuilt:

```bash
cd crates/gateway/ui
npm install              # first time only
npx tailwindcss -i input.css -o ../src/assets/style.css --minify
```

Use `npm run watch` during development for automatic rebuilds on file changes.
If styles don't appear after adding new Tailwind classes, this rebuild step was
likely missed.

### Selection Card UI Pattern

When presenting users with a choice between options (backends, models, plans),
use **clickable cards** instead of dropdowns. Cards provide better UX because:
- Users can see all options at once with descriptions
- Visual feedback (selected state) is clearer
- Badges can highlight recommended options or availability status

**Card structure** (see `.model-card`, `.backend-card` in `input.css`):
```html
<div class="backend-card selected">
  <div class="flex items-center justify-between">
    <span class="text-sm font-medium">Option Name</span>
    <div class="flex gap-2">
      <span class="recommended-badge">Recommended</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-xs text-[var(--muted)] mt-1">Description text</div>
</div>
```

**States**:
- `.selected` — highlighted with accent border/background
- `.disabled` — dimmed, cursor not-allowed, not clickable
- Default — hover shows border-strong and bg-hover

**Badges**:
- `.recommended-badge` — accent color, for the suggested option
- `.tier-badge` — muted color, for metadata (RAM requirements, "Not installed")

**Install hints**: When an option requires installation, show clear instructions:
```html
<div class="install-hint">Install with: <code>pip install mlx-lm</code></div>
```

### Provider Configuration Storage

Provider credentials and settings are stored in `~/.config/moltis/provider_keys.json`.
The `KeyStore` in `provider_setup.rs` manages this with:

- **Per-provider config object**: `{ "apiKey": "...", "baseUrl": "...", "model": "..." }`
- **Backward compatibility**: Migrates from old string-only format automatically
- **Partial updates**: `save_config()` preserves existing fields when updating

When adding new provider fields, update both:
1. `ProviderConfig` struct in `provider_setup.rs`
2. `available()` response to expose the field to the frontend
3. `save_key()` to accept and persist the new field

### Server-Injected Data (gon pattern)

When the frontend needs server-side data **at page load** (before any async
fetch completes), use the gon pattern instead of inline `<script>` DOM
manipulation or extra API calls:

**Rust side** — add a field to `GonData` in `server.rs` and populate it in
`build_gon_data()`. The struct is serialized and injected into `<head>` as
`<script>window.__MOLTIS__={...};</script>` on every page serve. Only put
request-independent data here (no cookies, no sessions — those still need
`/api/auth/status`).

```rust
// server.rs
#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
struct GonData {
    identity: moltis_config::ResolvedIdentity,
    // add new fields here
}
```

**JS side** — import `gon.js`:

```js
import * as gon from "./gon.js";

// Read server-injected data synchronously at module load.
var identity = gon.get("identity");

// React to changes (from set() or refresh()).
gon.onChange("identity", (id) => { /* update DOM */ });

// After a mutation (e.g. saving identity), refresh all gon data
// from the server. This re-fetches /api/gon and notifies all
// onChange listeners — no need to update specific fields manually.
gon.refresh();
```

**Do NOT**: inject inline `<script>` tags with `document.getElementById`
calls, build HTML strings in Rust, or use `body.replace` for DOM side effects.
All of those are fragile. The gon blob is the single injection point.
When data changes at runtime, call `gon.refresh()` instead of manually
updating individual fields — it keeps everything consistent.

### Event Bus (WebSocket events in JS)

Server-side broadcasts reach the UI via WebSocket frames. The JS event bus
lives in `events.js`:

```js
import { onEvent } from "./events.js";

// Subscribe to a named event. Returns an unsubscribe function.
var off = onEvent("mcp.status", (payload) => {
  // payload is the deserialized JSON from the broadcast
});

// In a Preact useEffect, return the unsubscribe for cleanup:
useEffect(() => {
  var off = onEvent("some.event", handler);
  return off;
}, []);
```

The WebSocket reader in `websocket.js` dispatches incoming event frames to
all registered listeners via `eventListeners[frame.event]`. Do **not** use
`window.addEventListener` / `CustomEvent` for server events — use this bus.

## API Namespace Convention

Each navigation tab in the UI should have its own API namespace, both for
REST endpoints (`/api/<feature>/...`) and RPC methods (`<feature>.*`). This
keeps concerns separated and makes it straightforward to gate each feature
behind a cargo feature flag (e.g. `#[cfg(feature = "skills")]`).

Examples: `/api/skills`, `/api/plugins`, `/api/channels`, with RPC methods
`skills.list`, `plugins.install`, `channels.status`, etc. Never merge
multiple features into a single endpoint.
## Authentication Architecture

The gateway supports password and passkey (WebAuthn) authentication, managed
in `crates/gateway/src/auth.rs` with routes in `auth_routes.rs` and middleware
in `auth_middleware.rs`.

Key concepts:

- **Setup code**: On first run (no password set), a random code is printed to
  the terminal. The user enters it on the `/setup` page to set a password or
  register a passkey. The code is single-use and cleared after setup.
- **Auth states**: `auth_disabled` (explicit `[auth] disabled = true` in
  config) and localhost-no-password (safe default) are distinct states.
  `auth_disabled` is a deliberate user choice; localhost-no-password is the
  initial state before setup.
- **Session cookies**: HTTP-only `moltis_session` cookie, validated by the
  auth middleware.
- **API keys**: Bearer token auth via `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header,
  managed through the settings UI.
- **Credential store**: `CredentialStore` in `auth.rs` persists passwords
  (argon2 hashed), passkeys, API keys, and session tokens to a JSON file.

The auth middleware (`RequireAuth`) protects all `/api/*` routes except
`/api/auth/*` and `/api/gon`.

## Testing

```bash
cargo test                           # Run all tests
cargo test <test_name>               # Run a specific test
cargo test <module>::               # Run all tests in a module
cargo test -- --nocapture            # Run tests with stdout visible
```

## Code Quality

```bash
cargo +nightly fmt       # Format code (uses nightly)
cargo +nightly clippy    # Run linter (uses nightly)
cargo check              # Fast compile check without producing binary
taplo fmt                # Format TOML files (Cargo.toml, etc.)
biome check --write      # Lint & format JavaScript files (installed via mise)
```

When editing `Cargo.toml` or other TOML files, run `taplo fmt` to format them
according to the project's `taplo.toml` configuration.

## Sandbox Architecture

The gateway runs user commands inside isolated containers (Docker or Apple
Container). Key files:

- `crates/tools/src/sandbox.rs` — `Sandbox` trait, `DockerSandbox`,
  `AppleContainerSandbox`, `SandboxRouter`, image build/list/clean helpers
- `crates/tools/src/exec.rs` — `ExecTool` that routes commands through the
  sandbox
- `crates/cli/src/sandbox_commands.rs` — `moltis sandbox` CLI subcommands
- `crates/config/src/schema.rs` — `SandboxConfig` with default packages list

### Pre-built images

Both backends support `build_image`: generate a Dockerfile with `FROM <base>`
+ `RUN apt-get install ...`, then run `docker build` / `container build`.
The image tag is a deterministic hash of the base image + sorted package
list (`sandbox_image_tag`). The gateway pre-builds at startup; if the image
already exists it's a no-op.

### Config-driven packages

Default packages are defined in `default_sandbox_packages()` in `schema.rs`.
On first run (no config file), a `moltis.toml` is written with all defaults
including the full packages list. Users edit that file to add/remove packages
and restart — the image tag changes automatically, triggering a rebuild.

### Shared helpers

`sandbox_image_tag`, `sandbox_image_exists`, `list_sandbox_images`,
`remove_sandbox_image`, `clean_sandbox_images` are module-level public
functions in `sandbox.rs`, parameterised by CLI binary name. The
`SandboxConfig::from(&config_schema::SandboxConfig)` impl converts the
config-crate types to tools-crate types — use it instead of manual
field-by-field conversion.

## Security

### WebSocket Origin validation (CSWSH protection)

The WebSocket upgrade handler in `server.rs` validates the `Origin` header.
Cross-origin requests are rejected with 403. Loopback variants (`localhost`,
`127.0.0.1`, `::1`) are treated as equivalent. Non-browser clients (no
Origin header) are allowed through.

This prevents the attack class from GHSA-g8p2-7wf7-98mq where a malicious
webpage could connect to the local gateway WebSocket from the victim's
browser.

### SSRF protection

`web_fetch.rs` resolves DNS and checks the resulting IP against blocked
ranges (loopback, private, link-local, CGNAT) before making HTTP requests.
Any changes to web_fetch must preserve this check.

## CLI Auth Commands

The `auth` subcommand (`crates/cli/src/auth_commands.rs`) provides:

- `moltis auth reset-password` — clear the stored password
- `moltis auth reset-identity` — clear identity and user profile (triggers
  onboarding on next load)

## CLI Sandbox Commands

The `sandbox` subcommand (`crates/cli/src/sandbox_commands.rs`) provides:

- `moltis sandbox list` — list pre-built `moltis-sandbox:*` images
- `moltis sandbox build` — build image from config (base + packages)
- `moltis sandbox remove <tag>` — remove a specific image
- `moltis sandbox clean` — remove all sandbox images

## Sensitive Data Handling

Never use plain `String` for passwords, API keys, tokens, or any secret
material. Use `secrecy::Secret<String>` instead — it redacts `Debug` output,
prevents accidental `Display`, and zeroes memory on drop.

```rust
use secrecy::{ExposeSecret, Secret};

// Store secrets wrapped
struct Config {
    api_key: Secret<String>,
}

// Construct: wrap at the boundary
let cfg = Config { api_key: Secret::new(raw_key) };

// Use: expose only at the point of consumption
req.header("Authorization", format!("Bearer {}", cfg.api_key.expose_secret()));
```

Rules:
- **Struct fields** holding secrets must be `Secret<String>` (or
  `Option<Secret<String>>`).
- **Function parameters** can stay `&str`; call `.expose_secret()` at the call
  site.
- **Serde deserialize** works automatically (secrecy's `serde` feature).
- **Serde serialize** requires a custom helper when round-tripping is needed
  (config files, token storage). See `serialize_secret` /
  `serialize_option_secret` in `crates/oauth/src/types.rs`.
- **Debug impls**: replace `#[derive(Debug)]` with a manual impl that prints
  `[REDACTED]` for secret fields.
- **RwLock guards**: when a `RwLock<Option<Secret<String>>>` read guard is
  followed by a write in the same function, scope the read guard in a block
  `{ let guard = lock.read().await; ... }` to avoid deadlocks.

## Data and Config Directories

Moltis uses two directories, **never** the current working directory:

- **Config dir** (`moltis_config::config_dir()`) — `~/.moltis/` by default.
  Contains `moltis.toml`, `credentials.json`, `mcp-servers.json`.
  Overridable via `--config-dir` or `MOLTIS_CONFIG_DIR`.
- **Data dir** (`moltis_config::data_dir()`) — `~/.moltis/` by default.
  Contains `moltis.db`, `memory.db`, `sessions/`, `logs.jsonl`,
  `MEMORY.md`, `memory/*.md`.
  Overridable via `--data-dir` or `MOLTIS_DATA_DIR`.

**Rules:**
- **Never use `std::env::current_dir()`** to resolve paths for persistent
  storage (databases, memory files, config). Always use `data_dir()` or
  `config_dir()`. Writing to cwd leaks files into the user's repo.
- When a function needs a storage path, pass `data_dir` explicitly or call
  `moltis_config::data_dir()`. Don't assume the process was started from a
  specific directory.
- The gateway's `run()` function resolves `data_dir` once at startup
  (`server.rs`) and threads it through. Prefer using that resolved value
  over calling `data_dir()` repeatedly.

## Database Migrations

Schema changes are managed via **sqlx migrations**. Each crate owns its migrations
in its own `migrations/` directory. See [docs/sqlite-migration.md](docs/sqlite-migration.md)
for full documentation.

**Architecture:**

- Each crate has its own `migrations/` directory and `run_migrations()` function
- Gateway orchestrates migrations at startup in dependency order
- Timestamp-based versioning (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`) for global uniqueness

**Crate ownership:**

| Crate | Tables |
|-------|--------|
| `moltis-projects` | `projects` |
| `moltis-sessions` | `sessions`, `channel_sessions` |
| `moltis-cron` | `cron_jobs`, `cron_runs` |
| `moltis-gateway` | `auth_*`, `passkeys`, `api_keys`, `env_variables`, `message_log`, `channels` |
| `moltis-memory` | `files`, `chunks`, `embedding_cache`, `chunks_fts` |

**Adding a migration to an existing crate:**

1. Create `crates/<crate>/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`
2. Write the SQL (use `IF NOT EXISTS` for new tables)
3. Rebuild (`cargo build`) to embed the migration

**Adding a new crate with migrations:**

1. Create `crates/new-crate/migrations/` directory
2. Add `run_migrations()` to `lib.rs`
3. Call it from `server.rs` in dependency order

## Provider Implementation Guidelines

### Async all the way down

Never use `block_on`, `std::thread::scope` + `rt.block_on`, or any blocking
call inside an async context (tokio runtime). This causes a panic:
"Cannot start a runtime from within a runtime". All token exchanges,
HTTP calls, and I/O in provider methods (`complete`, `stream`) must be `async`
and use `.await`. If a helper needs to make HTTP requests, make it `async fn`.

### Model lists for providers

When adding a new LLM provider, make the model list as complete as possible.
Models vary by plan/org and can change, so keep the list intentionally broad —
if a model isn't available the provider API will return an error and the user
can remove it from their config.

To find the correct model IDs:
- Check the upstream open-source implementations in `../clawdbot/` (TypeScript
  reference), as well as projects like OpenAI Codex CLI, Claude Code, opencode,
  etc.
- For "bring your own model" providers (OpenRouter, Venice, Ollama), don't
  hardcode a model list — require the user to specify a model via config.
- Ideally, query the provider's `/models` endpoint at registration time to
  build the list dynamically (not yet implemented).

## Plans and Session History

Plans are stored in `prompts/` (configured via `.claude/settings.json`).
When entering plan mode, plans are automatically saved there. After completing
a significant piece of work, write a brief session summary to
`prompts/session-YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` capturing what was done, key decisions,
and any open items.

## Changelog

This project keeps a changelog at `CHANGELOG.md` following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). When making
user-facing changes, **always** update the `[Unreleased]` section with a
bullet under the appropriate heading:

- **Added** — new features
- **Changed** — changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated** — soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed** — now removed features
- **Fixed** — bug fixes
- **Security** — vulnerability fixes

At release time the `[Unreleased]` section is renamed to the version number
with a date.

## Git Workflow

Follow conventional commit format: `feat|fix|refactor|docs|test|chore(scope): description`

**No Co-Authored-By trailers.** Never add `Co-Authored-By` lines (e.g.
`Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`) to commit messages or documentation. Commits
should only contain the message itself — no AI attribution trailers.

When adding a new feature (`feat` commits), update the features list in
`README.md` as part of the same branch/PR.

**Merging main into your branch:** When merging `main` into your current branch
and encountering conflicts, resolve them by keeping both sides of the changes.
Don't discard either the incoming changes from main or your local changes —
integrate them together so nothing is lost.

**You MUST run all checks before every commit and fix any issues they report:**
1. `cargo +nightly fmt --all` — format all Rust code (CI runs `cargo fmt --all -- --check`)
2. `cargo +nightly clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` — run linter (must pass with zero warnings)
3. `cargo test --all-features` — run all tests
4. `biome check --write` (when JS files were modified; CI runs `biome ci`)
5. `taplo fmt` (when TOML files were modified)

## Documentation

Documentation source files live in `docs/src/` (not `docs/` directly) and are built
with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/). The site is automatically deployed
to [docs.moltis.org](https://docs.moltis.org) on push to `main`.

**When adding or renaming docs:**

1. Add/edit your `.md` file in `docs/src/` — this is the source directory
2. Update `docs/src/SUMMARY.md` to include the new page in the navigation
3. Preview locally with `cd docs && mdbook serve`

**Directory structure:**

```
docs/
├── book.toml          # mdBook configuration
├── src/               # ← Markdown source files go here
│   ├── SUMMARY.md     # Navigation structure
│   ├── index.md       # Landing page
│   └── *.md           # Documentation pages
├── theme/             # Custom CSS
└── book/              # Built output (gitignored)
```

**Local commands:**

```bash
cd docs
mdbook serve      # Preview at http://localhost:3000 (auto-reloads)
mdbook build      # Build to docs/book/
```

The theme matches [moltis.org](https://www.moltis.org) with Space Grotesk / Outfit fonts
and orange accent colors. Use admonish blocks for callouts:

```markdown
\`\`\`admonish info title="Note"
Important information here.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`admonish warning
Be careful about this.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`admonish tip
Helpful suggestion.
\`\`\`
```
