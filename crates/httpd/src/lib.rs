//! HTTP/WebSocket transport layer for the moltis gateway.
//!
//! This crate provides the HTTP server, WebSocket upgrade handler,
//! authentication middleware, and all HTTP route handlers. It depends
//! on `moltis-gateway` for core business logic but never the reverse.
//!
//! Non-HTTP consumers (TUI, tests) can depend on `moltis-gateway`
//! directly without pulling in the HTTP stack.
