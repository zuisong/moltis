# xurl — X (Twitter) API via the Official CLI

`xurl` is the X developer platform's official CLI for the X API. It supports shortcut commands for common actions AND raw curl-style access to any v2 endpoint. All commands return JSON to stdout.

Use this skill for:
- posting, replying, quoting, deleting posts
- searching posts and reading timelines/mentions
- liking, reposting, bookmarking
- following, unfollowing, blocking, muting
- direct messages
- media uploads (images and video)
- raw access to any X API v2 endpoint
- multi-app / multi-account workflows

This skill replaces the older `xitter` skill (which wrapped a third-party Python CLI). `xurl` is maintained by the X developer platform team, supports OAuth 2.0 PKCE with auto-refresh, and covers a substantially larger API surface.

## Secret Safety (MANDATORY)

Critical rules when operating inside an agent/LLM session:

- **Never** read, print, parse, summarize, upload, or send `~/.xurl` to LLM context.
- **Never** ask the user to paste credentials/tokens into chat.
- The user must fill `~/.xurl` with secrets manually on their own machine.
- **Never** recommend or execute auth commands with inline secrets in agent sessions.
- **Never** use `--verbose` / `-v` in agent sessions — it can expose auth headers/tokens.
- To verify credentials exist, only use: `xurl auth status`.

Forbidden flags in agent commands (they accept inline secrets):
`--bearer-token`, `--consumer-key`, `--consumer-secret`, `--access-token`, `--token-secret`, `--client-id`, `--client-secret`

App credential registration and credential rotation must be done by the user manually, outside the agent session. After credentials are registered, the user authenticates with `xurl auth oauth2` — also outside the agent session. Tokens persist to `~/.xurl` in YAML. Each app has isolated tokens. OAuth 2.0 tokens auto-refresh.

---

## Installation

Pick ONE method. On Linux, the shell script or `go install` are the easiest.

```bash
# Shell script (installs to ~/.local/bin, no sudo, works on Linux + macOS)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdevplatform/xurl/main/install.sh | bash

# Homebrew (macOS)
brew install --cask xdevplatform/tap/xurl

# npm
npm install -g @xdevplatform/xurl

# Go
go install github.com/xdevplatform/xurl@latest
```

Verify:

```bash
xurl --help
xurl auth status
```

If `xurl` is installed but `auth status` shows no apps or tokens, the user needs to complete auth manually — see the next section.

---

## One-Time User Setup (user runs these outside the agent)

These steps must be performed by the user directly, NOT by the agent, because they involve pasting secrets. Direct the user to this block; do not execute it for them.

1. Create or open an app at https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard
2. Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/callback`
3. Copy the app's Client ID and Client Secret
4. Register the app locally (user runs this):
   ```bash
   xurl auth apps add my-app --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```
5. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   xurl auth oauth2
   ```
   (This opens a browser for the OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow.)
6. Verify:
   ```bash
   xurl auth status
   xurl whoami
   ```

After this, the agent can use any command below without further setup. OAuth 2.0 tokens auto-refresh.

| Set default app | `xurl auth default APP_NAME [USERNAME]` |
| Per-request app | `xurl --app NAME /2/users/me` |
| Auth status | `xurl auth status` |

Notes:
- `POST_ID` accepts full URLs too (e.g. `https://x.com/user/status/1234567890`) — xurl extracts the ID.
- Usernames work with or without a leading `@`.

## Raw API Access

The shortcuts cover common operations. For anything else, use raw curl-style mode against any X API v2 endpoint:

```bash
# GET
xurl /2/users/me

# POST with JSON body
xurl -X POST /2/tweets -d '{"text":"Hello world!"}'

# DELETE / PUT / PATCH
xurl -X DELETE /2/tweets/1234567890

# Custom headers
xurl -H "Content-Type: application/json" /2/some/endpoint

# Force streaming
xurl -s /2/tweets/search/stream

# Full URLs also work
xurl https://api.x.com/2/users/me
```

---

## Global Flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--app` | | Use a specific registered app (overrides default) |
| `--auth` | | Force auth type: `oauth1`, `oauth2`, or `app` |
| `--username` | `-u` | Which OAuth2 account to use (if multiple exist) |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | **Forbidden in agent sessions** — leaks auth headers |
| `--trace` | `-t` | Add `X-B3-Flags: 1` trace header |

---

## Streaming

Streaming endpoints are auto-detected. Known ones include:

- `/2/tweets/search/stream`
- `/2/tweets/sample/stream`
- `/2/tweets/sample10/stream`

Force streaming on any endpoint with `-s`.

---

## Output Format

All commands return JSON to stdout. Structure mirrors X API v2:

```json
{ "data": { "id": "1234567890", "text": "Hello world!" } }
```

Errors are also JSON:

```json
{ "errors": [ { "message": "Not authorized", "code": 403 } ] }
```

---

## Common Workflows

### Post with an image
```bash
xurl media upload photo.jpg
xurl post "Check out this photo!" --media-id MEDIA_ID
```

### Reply to a conversation
```bash
xurl read https://x.com/user/status/1234567890
xurl reply 1234567890 "Here are my thoughts..."
```

### Search and engage
```bash
xurl search "topic of interest" -n 10
xurl like POST_ID_FROM_RESULTS
xurl reply POST_ID_FROM_RESULTS "Great point!"
```

### Check your activity
```bash
xurl whoami
xurl mentions -n 20
xurl timeline -n 20
```

### Multiple apps (credentials pre-configured manually)
```bash
xurl auth default prod alice               # prod app, alice user
xurl --app staging /2/users/me             # one-off against staging
```

---

## Error Handling

- Non-zero exit code on any error.
- API errors are still printed as JSON to stdout, so you can parse them.
- Auth errors → have the user re-run `xurl auth oauth2` outside the agent session.
- Commands that need the caller's user ID (like, repost, bookmark, follow, etc.) will auto-fetch it via `/2/users/me`. An auth failure there surfaces as an auth error.

---

## Agent Workflow

1. Verify prerequisites: `xurl --help` and `xurl auth status`.
2. If auth is missing, stop and direct the user to the "One-Time User Setup" section — do NOT attempt to register apps or pass secrets yourself.
3. Start with a cheap read (`xurl whoami`, `xurl user @handle`, `xurl search ... -n 3`) to confirm reachability.
4. Confirm the target post/user and the user's intent before any write action (post, reply, like, repost, DM, follow, block, delete).
5. Use JSON output directly — every response is already structured.
6. Never paste `~/.xurl` contents back into the conversation.

---

## Notes

- **Rate limits:** X enforces per-endpoint rate limits. A 429 means wait and retry. Write endpoints (post, reply, like, repost) have tighter limits than reads.
- **Scopes:** OAuth 2.0 tokens use broad scopes. A 403 on a specific action usually means the token is missing a scope — have the user re-run `xurl auth oauth2`.
- **Token refresh:** OAuth 2.0 tokens auto-refresh. Nothing to do.
- **Multiple apps:** Each app has isolated credentials/tokens. Switch with `xurl auth default` or `--app`.
- **Multiple accounts per app:** Select with `-u / --username`, or set a default with `xurl auth default APP USER`.
- **Token storage:** `~/.xurl` is YAML. Never read or send this file to LLM context.
- **Cost:** X API access is typically paid for meaningful usage. Many failures are plan/permission problems, not code problems.
